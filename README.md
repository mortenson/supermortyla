I thought it would be fun if my wedding guests got to play a video game before they RSVP'd, so I threw together a simple platformer that lets you play as me and my wife.

I wanted to push up the source so that other people using Quintus could benefit from it, but if I had more time or this was a production project, I would have done a lot differently! Even if it's a bit messy, it was fun to write and (most) people who played it had a good time.
